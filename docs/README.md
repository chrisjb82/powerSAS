# PowerSAS documentation

Each powerSAS command has powershell `Get-Help` documentation, which is also available as markdown files in this directory.

The typical sequence of powerSAS commands in a session is shown below:

```sequence{theme="hand"}
User ->> SAS_Server : Connect-SAS
User ->> SAS_Sever : Disconnect-SAS
```
